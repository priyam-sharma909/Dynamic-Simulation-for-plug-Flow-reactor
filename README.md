# Butane Isomerization Reactor Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates the isomerization of normal butane to isobutane in a plug flow reactor (PFR) with a cooling jacket for temperature control. The simulation dynamically tracks the temperature and conversion profiles along the reactorâ€™s volume and length using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The simulation compares reactor performance under two different coolant temperatures: 300 K and 315 K.

## Key Equations Used

### 1. Reaction Rate

The reaction rate is defined as:

$$
r_A = -k \cdot C_{A0} \left[ 1 - \left( 1 + \frac{1}{K_{eq}} \right) X \right]
$$

Where:
- \( k = 31.1 \cdot e^{7906 \left( \frac{T - 360}{360T} \right)} \) is the rate constant.
- \( K_{eq} = e^{-830.3 \left( \frac{T - 333}{333T} \right)} \) is the equilibrium constant.

---

### 2. Conversion Change

The change in conversion with reactor volume is given by:

$$
\frac{dX}{dV} = \frac{-r_A}{F_{A0}}
$$

Where:
- \( X \) is the conversion.
- \( F_{A0} \) is the molar flow rate of the reactant.

---

### 3. Temperature Change

The temperature change inside the reactor is governed by:

$$
\frac{dT}{dV} = \frac{ \Delta H_r \cdot r_A - U_a (T - T_a) }{ F_{A0} \cdot C_p }
$$

Where:
- \( \Delta H_r \) is the heat of reaction.
- \( U_a \) is the heat transfer coefficient.
- \( T_a \) is the coolant temperature.
- \( C_p \) is the specific heat capacity of the fluid.
